# This file relies on some implementation details of JRuby+Truffle and Truffle,
# so be careful as you edit. Every block that you pass to example must be
# unique - so you can't always build up examples by running in a loop or using
# helper method. truffle_assert_constant looks like a method but is replaced
# in the parser with a specific node.
